** Current status

work in progress

** Data Source

We are thinking about a module that extracts [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS][Short Message Service
(SMS)]] messages from a backup of your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)][Android]] smartphone. We have to
test various methods before being able to tell more.

** Example Invocation

work in progress

** Example Orgmode entries

Probably such an SMS might look like:

: ** "Hello brother, how are you?"               :SMS:Memacs:
