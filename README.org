Memacs extracts metadata from many different existing data sources on
your computer and generates files which are readable by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][GNU Emacs]] with
[[http://orgmode.org][Org-mode]].

Memacs - as the central component of the system - is a hub for all the
connectors that add data from individual data sources. Those connectors
are called "Nexus".

* Advantages: an Example Use Case

Imagine you are already using a Memacs.

When remembering that day, when you joined an interesting talk about
"[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][Getting Things Done]]" (GTD), you start up your GNU Emacs with your main
Org-mode file. There you go to the Agenda-view and select this
specific day a couple of months ago.

There it is, from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. you scheduled this talk in your
calendar. And then you realize that within this time frame, there
appear some [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg][JPEG files]]: files like "2011-02-14T14.35.42_img_0815.jpg"
are containing an [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html][ISO 8601]] time stamp (with periods instead of
colons - just because the [[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(v%3Dvs.85).aspx#naming_conventions][ancient limitations of Microsoft based file
systems]]) are indexed by one Nexus. (Filedatestamp-locate-Nexus)

This image contains a slide you found interesting and which you
photographed using your sleek smartphone. Who would remember having
taken a picture during a talk?

Ten minutes after the talk you wrote a short message on [[http://Titter.com][Twitter]] where
you mentioned useful URLs for your followers. This time those URLs are
handy for yourself too! (Twitter-Nexus)

On the evening of that day you see an entry of an incoming email from
the author of the talk. Now you remember having had a cool
conversation at the end of the talk where he promised you some
additional information about that nice little GTD tool on his
computer. Great that you got that link to that email too. Without
Memacs you would probably never got to that email
again. (Maildir-Nexus)

And then there were some bookmarks you saved this day, almost all
related to ideas you got from the GTD talk. (delicious-Nexus)

This small story shows only a few use cases where different Nexuses
combine given data sources and their information to provide an overall
view related to an event. Since Org-mode has got links, no actual data
has to be duplicated (except the small meta data extracted by
Memacs). Emails, files, bookmarks, and so forth are linked rather than
copied.

** Scalability

Memacs is generating [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Archiving][Org-mode archive files]]. That means that in normal
mode, Memacs information does not interfere with the Org-mode data you
are processing daily. Only when you choose to get the archive files
visualized too ([[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Agenda-commands]["v A" in Agenda-view]]) you are confronted with the data
Memacs extracted for you.

This should not lead to any slow down in your daily work while having
the tremendous opportunity to get the verbose information on demand.

* Nexuses

This section contains a list of current and future Nexuses which
extract data from all kinds of data sources.

The exact details are subject of constant development.

Each Nexus offers various settings:
- configuration is done in one ini file for all Nexuses and Memacs OR
  separately (not decided yet)
- time stamp offset in order to "correct" time stamps resulting in
  wrong server configuration or other time zone
- default tag
  - each Memacs entry gets one common tag "Memacs"
  - each Nexus can define one common tag according to the Nexus
  - each Nexus can derive additional tags related to the data source

** Filedatestamp-locate-Nexus

Files with an filename that consists of an [[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html][ISO 8601]] time stamp like
"2011-02-14T14.35.42_img_0815.jpg" or "2011-02-14 slide GTD tools.jpg"
contain a direct reference to a certain day (or time).

On GNU/Linux systems, you have already an file name indexing tool
named "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locate_(Unix)][locate]]" which already offers an index of all of your file names
and their paths.

This Nexus filters ISO time stamps and generates a view containing
entries like this:
#+begin_example
: ** [[file:~/path/2011-02-14T14.35.42_img_0815.jpg][2011-02-14T14.35.42_img_0815.jpg]]  :Memacs:locate:

#+end_example

** delicious-Nexus

Bookmarks saved on the social bookmark service of [[http://delicious.com][delicious]] are an
important source of data. We have not yet decided whether we will
get the data using the [[http://www.delicious.com/help/api][delicious API]] and [[http://code.google.com/p/pydelicious/][pydelicious]] or if we are
simply using the file that results from (manual) [[https://secure.delicious.com/settings/bookmarks/export][XML export]].

Bookmarks will look like the following which was tagged with "tools"
and "research" at delicious:
#+begin_example
: ** [[http://tagstore.org][tagstore]]           :Memacs:delicious:tools:research:

[[http://grabeeter.tugraz.at/][Grabeeter]] is a free online service of [[http://www.TU-Graz.at][Graz University of Technology]]
where you can search and archive your tweets from [[http://Twitter.com][Twitter]].

Maybe there will be a future Nexus which accesses a [[http://andrewprice.me.uk/projects/twyt/][Twitter API]]
but for now we will stick to the faster and more reliable Tweet
archiving service of Grabeeter.

Tweets like this one from user "n0v0id" will appear like this:
#+begin_example

** Maildir-Nexus
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: Maildir
:END:

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maildir][Maildir]] is a common standard to store e-mails on disk. Many users do
have a local mail repository in Maildir format. Accessing e-mails in
Maildir folders is fairly easy because each e-mail is one file in an
ordinary folder.

We will probably visualize an e-mail from Maildir like this:
#+begin_example
: ** [[file:~/Maildir/cur/emailfile.txt][Urgent: Serverload too high]]   :maildir:Memacs:

#+end_example

** tagstore-Nexus

[[http://tagstore.org][tagstore]] is a research software that stores local files using tags and
derives associative navigational folder structures from the tags of
the files.

This Nexus collects events like adding a new file to a store and
generates entries like this: (the file was tagged with "CustomerA" and
"ProjectB")
#+begin_example
: ** [[file:~/tagstore/Invoice_0815.pdf][Invoice_0815.pdf]]  :ProjectB:CustomerA:tagstore:Memacs:

** GoogleCalendar-Nexus

We might be able to provide a Nexus that gets events from a [[http://www.google.com/calendar][Google
calendar]] using [[http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide_python.html][an API]].

Those calendar events might be looking like this:
#+begin_example
: *** [[http://example.com/link/to/event][Meeting with Customer]]      :GCal:Memacs:
:   <2011-07-23 Sat 14:00-15:30>

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control][Version control systems]] are quite common to manage all kind of data
with. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)][git]] is a modern distributed system that has an enormous feature
set.

Whenever user "Bob" commits a change set to an example project called
"myproject", git-Nexus can provide an entry like this:
#+begin_example
: ** myproject (Bob): solved the address field bug         :git:Menacs:

** svn-Nexus

Version control systems]] are quite common to manage all kind of data
with. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion][Subversion (SVN)]] is a modern system that is widely used for
revision control.

Whenever user "Bob" commits a change set (resulting in revision 42) to
an example project called "myproject", svn-Nexus can provide an entry
like this:
#+begin_example
: *** myproject (Bob) r42: solved the address field bug       :svn:Menacs:

** SMS-backup-Nexus

We are thinking about a Nexus that extracts [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS][Short Message Service
(SMS)]] messages from a backup of your [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)][Android]] smartphone. We have to
test various methods before being able to tell more.

Probably such an SMS might look like:
#+begin_example
: *** "Hello brother, how are you?"               :SMS:Memacs:

** JPilot-todo-Nexus

[[http://www.jpilot.org/][J-Pilot]] is a software that were used by many [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_OS][Palm OS]] users on
GNU/Linux. It contains your Palm OS agenda, todos, contact
informations, and memos.

Since many users still appreciate the [[http://www.pimlicosoftware.com/datebk6.htm][mature software]] to organize
their life, this Nexus generates Org-mode entries from J-Pilot export
data.

Such an todo entry might look like this:
#+begin_example

* Background

In 1945, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vannevar_Bush][Vannevar Bush]] wrote a famous article "[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_We_May_Think][As We May Think]]" where
he develops the idea of having a "memory extender" called Memex. The
memex can store all letters, books, and other information which are
related to a person.

Besides having foreseen several technologies like hypertext, he
defined a device that holds all metadata and data and provides
associative trails to access information.

In the last decade of the previous century Microsoft Research had a
research program that resulted in [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MyLifeBits][MyLifeBits]]. This software tried to
store each information of the user like office documents, screenshots,
name of active windows on the desktop computer, and even automatically
took photographs ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensecam][SenseCam]]). This word did not result in any (open)
software product. Bell and Gemmell wrote a book called "[[http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0525951342/ref%3Das_li_ss_tl?ie%3DUTF8&tag%3Dkarlssuder-21&linkCode%3Das2&camp%3D1638&creative%3D19454&creativeASIN%3D0525951342][Total Recall]]".

The Memacs project tries to implement the ideas of Vannevar Bush's
vision with open source and open standards. It's name "Memacs" is the
obvious combination of "GNU Emacs" and "Memex".

Memacs uses GNU Emacs Org-mode to visualize and access information
extracted by Memacs Nexuses: using tags, time stamps, full text
search, and so forth GNU Emacs is able to derive different
views. The most important view probably is the [[http://orgmode.org/org.html#Agenda-Views][Agenda-view]] where you
can see anything that happened during a specific day/week/month
according to the time frame selected. But you can derive other views
too. For example you can choose to generate a condensed search result
using a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(logic)][boolean combination]] of tags.

Deeply related to Memacs, the project leader developed a research
software [[http://tagstore.org][tagstore]]. This system allows users to store (local) files
using tags an not a hierarchy of folders. As a natural extension,
tagstore targets associative access for (local) files. You might want
to check out tagstore too. Memacs and tagstore are a very useful
combination.


* Contribute! We are looking for your ideas:

If you want to contribute to this cool project, please fork and
contribute or write an additional Nexus!

We are sure that there are a *lot* of cool ideas for other Nexuses out
there!

Memacs is designed with respect to minimal effort for new Nexuses.

We are using [[http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/][Python PEP8]] and [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development][Test Driven Development (TDD)]].
