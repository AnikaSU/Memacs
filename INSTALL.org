* How to install and set up Memacs

** *Obtain Memacs*

- using one of github download mechanisms OR
- use ~pip install memacs~ which handles dependencies
  - you might as well want to use [[http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv][virtualenv]] before
- make sure that you have *Python v2.7* installed

** *Choose* the *modules* you want to use

- read the files in the ~docs~ folder

** *Set up one module* after another

- please do read ~docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org~
  - it contains many tips and tricks on how to meet your
    requirements and on how to choose a reasonable setup
- start the module of your choice with the argument ~--help~
  - modules are located in the ~bin~ sub-folder
  - for example: ~/memacs/bin % ./memacs_svn.py --help~
  - each module has some general arguments and module-specific arguments
- you probably want to *develop and test a module invocation* in the
  command line and when it works:
- set up a periodical invocation
  - read the ~Invocation~ section of ~docs/FAQs_and_Best_Practices.org~
